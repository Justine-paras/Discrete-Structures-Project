# 📍 DLSU–D Toolkit: Campus Navigation, Scholarship Checker, and Parking System

A multi-feature Python + HTML/CSS/JS toolkit applying **Discrete Structures** concepts to real DLSU-D campus problems.  
This project integrates **Graph Theory**, **Propositional Logic**, and **Set Theory** to create three functional prototypes packaged in a GUI.

---

## ⭐ Features

### **1. Campus Navigation System**
Uses **Graph Theory + Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to compute the shortest walking path between major DLSU-D buildings.

- Weighted graph representation  
- Interactive GUI selection  
- Visual path rendering  
- Helps freshmen and visitors navigate efficiently  

### **2. Scholarship Eligibility Checker**
A logic-based evaluator that determines student eligibility using **propositional logic**.

- Requirements mapped to Boolean variables (GPA, units, citizenship, varsity, etc.)  
- Logical formulas (conjunction + implication)  
- Clear feedback on missing requirements  
- Supports multiple scholarship types  

### **3. Smart Parking Allocation**
A lightweight parking manager using **Set Theory**.

- Parking lots represented as sets  
- Availability computed using set operations  
- Add/remove occupied slots  
- Simple interface for viewing and updating parking status
